        <p>I am a HCI+Social Computing researcher studying technology mediated online social behavior and emotional wellbeing in the online space + mental healthcare accessibility particularly in South Asia (and South Asian communities). I have two main goals based off of my research interest:
        <ul class="a">
        <li>Contribute towards making the online social environment a safe, just, and an inclusive space</li>
        <li>Ease of mental healthcare access particularly in communities with a strong stigma against mental health</li>
        </ul> 
        I am a first year PhD student in the <u><a href = "https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/computing/academics/graduates/programsofstudy/phdinhcc.html"></a></u> Human-Centered Computing program at Clemson University.  I am advised by <u><a href = "https://www.usabart.nl/portfolio/#home.html"> Dr. Bart Knijnenburg</a></u> and <u><a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/dzrpt-lab/about?authuser=0">Dr.Nina Hubig</a></u> at the <u><a href = "http://www.hatlab.org/">HATLab</a></u> and the <u><a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/dzrpt-lab/projects?authuser=0">DZRPT Lab</a></u>.         Before coming to Clemson, I got my Master's in Mathematics and Information Technolofy from Georgia Southern University (Summer 2020) in Statesboro, GA and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering  from Brac University (Fall 2013) in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

		<!-- <p>I like to cook, solve puzzles, and go on hikes. You will often find me making a lot of Harry Potter references, and watching reruns of Grey's Anatomy seasons 1 - 7. I am a very climate conscious person and I try to do my part to keep our environment healthy and clean. I will dabble into painting every now and again; I mostly make abstract paintings but recently I got into modern art and am enjoying it a lot!</p> -->
