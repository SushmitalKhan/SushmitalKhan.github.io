        <p>I am a first year PhD student in the Human-Centered Computing program at Clemson University. I am advised by <u><a href = "https://www.usabart.nl/portfolio/#home.html">Dr. Bart Knijnenburg</a></u> and <u><a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/dzrpt-lab/about?authuser=0">Dr.Nina Hubig</a></u>.
        </p>
        <p>
        I study human behavior in online communities with the overarching goal of making the internet a just, inclusive and safe environment. Specificially my work focuses on online toxicity, social equity, psychological impacts of cyber bullying and harassment, and mental health accessibility particularly in South Asia(and South Asian communities). </p>
		<p>
		To that end I work on developing methods for mining and identifying various behavioral aspects at the <u><a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/dzrpt-lab/projects?authuser=0">DZRPT Lab</a></u> and studying online users' wellbeing at the <u><a href = "http://www.hatlab.org/">HATLab</a></u>. </p>
		
		<p>Broadly speaking, my research interests are in Social Computing and Human-centered AI.</p>
        
		<p>Beyond research, I like to cook, solve puzzles and go on hikes. I am a very climate conscious person and I try to do my part to 
		keep our environment safe and clean. </p>
        <p> You can email me at sushmik [at] clemson.edu to talk about research, life and more! </p>
