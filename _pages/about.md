		I am a HCI+Social Computing researcher working with privacy behavior in online communities, recommender systems, and mental health. The main goals leading my researches are:
				
			<ul class="a">
				<li>Contribute towards making the online social environment a safe, and an inclusive space</li>
				<li>Help online users be in control of and understand their profiles better</li>
				<li>Easy access to mental healthcare particularly in communities with a strong stigma against mental health</li>

		<!-- <p>I like to cook, solve puzzles, and go on hikes. You will often find me making a lot of Harry Potter references, and watching reruns of Grey's Anatomy seasons 1 - 7. I am a very climate conscious person and I try to do my part to keep our environment healthy and clean. I will dabble into painting every now and again; I mostly make abstract paintings but recently I got into modern art and am enjoying it a lot!</p> -->
