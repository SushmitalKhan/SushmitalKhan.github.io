I am a first year PhD student in the Human-Centered Computing program at Clemson University. I am advised by <u><a href = "https://www.usabart.nl/portfolio/#home.html">Dr. Bart Knijnenburg</a></u> and <u><a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/dzrpt-lab/about?authuser=0">Dr. Nina  Hubig</a>. 
<h1>Research</h1>
I study human behavior in online communities with the overarching goal of making the internet a just, inclusive and safe environment. To that end I work with identifying hateful behavior and studying online users' wellbeing to design online environment that foster kindness and encourages just and inclusive behavior towards users from heterogeneous backgrounds. 

Broadly speaking, my research interests are in Social Computing and Human-centered AI. 

You can find my articles on <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QAn9xN8AAAAJ&hl=en">my Google Scholar profile</a>.</u>

I write about things that bother me and things that interest me. <u><a href="https://medium.com/@sushmita_khan">Check out my blog posts! </a></u>
