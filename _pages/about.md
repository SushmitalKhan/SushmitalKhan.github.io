Hi! I am Sushmita, first year HCC PhD student at Clemson University. I have a Master's in Mathematics from Georgia Southern University and undergrad in CSE from Brac University.

<h1>Research</h1>
I study human behavior in online communities with the overarching goal of making the internet a just, inclusive and safe environment. To that end I work with identifying hateful behavior and studying online users' wellbeing to design online environment that foster kindness and encourages just and inclusive behavior towards users from heterogeneous backgrounds. 

Broadly speaking, my research interests are in Social Computing and Human-centered AI.
