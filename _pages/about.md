        <p>I am a first year PhD student in the Human-Centered Computing program at Clemson University. I am advised by <u><a href = "https://www.usabart.nl/portfolio/#home.html">Dr. Bart Knijnenburg</a></u> and <u><a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/dzrpt-lab/about?authuser=0">Dr.Nina Hubig</a></u>.

        I study human behavior in online communities with the overarching goal of making the internet a just, inclusive, and safe environment. 
        
        To achieve my goal, I research several behavorial aspects of technology mediated online social behavior: 
        <ul class="a">
        <li>Online users privacy knowledge and practice</li>
        <li>Motivators of toxic engagement and psychological impacts of cyber bullying and harassment</li>
        <li>Emotions in communications, in particular empathetic communication</li>
        </ul>
</p>
        <p>I am also interested in investigating mental and emotional wellbeing in online spaces, and mental health accessibility particularly in South Asia (and South Asian communities) to mitigate the stigma revolving around seeking and accessing mental health. </p>
		<p>
		I work on developing methods for mining and identifying various behavioral aspects at the <u><a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/dzrpt-lab/projects?authuser=0">DZRPT Lab</a></u> and studying online users' privacy knoweldge, privacy practice, and wellbeing at the <u><a href = "http://www.hatlab.org/">HATLab</a></u>. </p>
		        
		<p>I like to cook, solve puzzles, and go on hikes. You will often find me making a lot of Harry Potter references, and watching reruns of Grey's Anatomy seasons 1 - 7. I am a very climate conscious person and I try to do my part to keep our environment healthy and clean. I will dabble into painting every now and again; I mostly make abstract paintings but recently I got into modern art and am enjoying it a lot!</p>
