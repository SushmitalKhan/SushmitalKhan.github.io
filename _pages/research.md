<p>       
        I study technology mediated online social behavior with the overarching goal of making the internet a just, inclusive, and safe environment. 
        
        To achieve my goal, I research several behavorial aspects including: 
        <ul class="a">
        <li>Online users privacy knowledge and practice</li>
        <li>Motivators of toxic engagement and psychological impacts of cyber bullying and harassment</li>
        <li>Emotions in communications, in particular empathetic communication</li>
        </ul>
</p>
        <p>I am also interested in investigating mental and emotional wellbeing in online spaces, and mental health accessibility particularly in South Asia (and South Asian communities) to mitigate the stigma revolving around seeking and accessing mental health. </p>
