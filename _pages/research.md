		<h3>Mathematically-grounded metaphors to teach AI-related cybersecurity</h3>
		
		The goal of this project is to investigate middle school student's AI-related cybersecurity knowledge relative to their mathematics knowledge and behavior. To investigate their knowledge, we administered an initial survey, and selected 33 participants for semi-structured interviews. We are using the data from interview to develop a Math based learning module for AI and cybersecurity. To optimize the impact of this project, we will implement the module in a rural-identifying middle in SC that serves underrepresented students.
